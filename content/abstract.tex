  As methods for censoring browsing and discovering private browsing information have improved, interest in anonymization methods has increased. Unfortunately, existing approaches to unrestricted, unsurveilled Internet access such
as I2P and Tor suffer from a tragedy of the commons – only a few thousand unpaid volunteers host proxies and exit nodes, allowing sophisticated attackers a tractable number of nodes to monitor or otherwise compromise. We present a market based, fully decentralized, anonymous peer-to-peer system based on “bandwidth mining” which we hope will address this lack of relays by paying them.

  %% The Internet's current structure is the product of two forces: (1)
  %% what is easy to implement for a small to medium sized company, and
  %% (2) the desires of mankind.

  %% Unfortunately, not all desires of mankind have proved agreeable. For
  %% example, as methods for censoring browsing and discovering private
  %% browsing information have improved, consumers have found themselves
  %% in the unenviable position of needing to decide between their
  %% privacy and usable Internet access. Even for those willing to suffer
  %% the usability hit, current methods to achieve unrestricted,
  %% unsurveilled Internet access such as I2P and Tor suffer from a
  %% tragedy of the commons – only a few thousand unpaid volunteers host
  %% proxies and exit nodes, allowing sophisticated attackers a tractable
  %% number of nodes to monitor or otherwise compromise.

  %% Similarly, not all desirable services have proved easy to
  %% implement. Perverse economic incentives stemming from widely
  %% available free content have resulted in a news media bereft of
  %% subscribers, slowly descending into a minute-to-minute battle for
  %% clicks. The high cost of distributing video has resulted in
  %% centralization, platforms, and burdens on content creators. The
  %% difficulty of maintaining and securing a sever have resulted in less
  %% diversity than one might have hoped for.

  %% To address these issues, we present a high performance approach to
  %% networking built on a foundation of micropayments, and as an initial
  %% application of the technology, build an uncensorable, anonymous
  %% mechanism for accessing the global Internet. It is our hope that as
  %% the tokens gain in acceptance, many millions of websites will
  %% incorporate the payment models described here, and consumers will
  %% receive a monthly budget of tokens from their ISP.

  Contributions include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A blockchain-based stochastic payment mechanism with
    transaction costs on the order of a packet.
  \item A commodity specification for the sale of bandwidth.
  \item A method for distributed inductive proofs in peer-to-peer
    systems which make Eclipse attacks arbitrarily difficult.
  \item An efficient security-hardened auction mechanism suited for
    the sale of bandwidth in circumstances where an attacker may alter
    their bid as part of an attack.
  \item A fully distributed anonymous bandwidth market.
  \end{itemize}
