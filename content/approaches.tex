\subsection{Unprotected Internet Access}

Users simply browsing the internet without protection are simply
handing over their data to their ISP, the websites they use, and
anyone either of those companies wishes to share it with.

\subsection{Virtual Private Networking (VPN) Services}

VPNs create encrypted connections between an end user and the VPN
server, which can be effective for circumventing
censorship. Unfortunately, VPN services are a very poor approach for
those users seeking anonymity – the VPN provider has complete payment
information for the subscriber in question, and may be hacked,
wiretapped, or otherwise compelled to report your browsing
information.

\subsection{Tor}

Tor\cite{TOR} is a free software project famous for introducing the
idea of Onion Routing to a wider audience. In the system, users
download a global list of relays and exit nodes, select from that list
randomly, and form ``onion routes'' from their selection. Onion routes
are an ordered list of relays; packets sent along an onion route are
encrypted for each peer in turn, ensuring that each node must have
received a packet enroute to the exit node for the exit to understand
it. A side effect of this forwarding is that, unless several nodes are
compromised or run by the same user, no two relays know both who sent
a packet and where it went.

%% TODO: section on Dingledine knowing ~75% of relay operators personally.

%% \subsection{Tor with Incentives}

%% \subsection{I2P}

%% I2P is billed as a “next generation” onion router. It is primarily
%% focused on communication internal

%% \subsection{Mixmaster, Mixminion, and other Chaumian relay schemes}

%% These are cool!
