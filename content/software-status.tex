[Note the software is being actively developed right now. The
  following describes where we hope to be when we publicly release
  this whitepaper. Current, and potentially obsolete comments are in
  brackets.]

\subsection{Software for the Ethereum Platform}

We have a ERC20 compliant token, a smart-contract implementing
stochastic micropayments as described in Section \ref{sec:tickets},
including javascript helper functions for the creation, validation,
and claiming of ticket winnings. Readers interested in viewing or
auditing the code are invited to visit [TODO: public github link.]

[Initial implementation here is complete. We are beginning the
  security audits of this, and polishing while we wait.]

\subsection{Core Networking Client}

We have completed an initial implementation of the proceeding protocol
in Microsoft's TypeScript (a statically typed variant of the
javascript language which compiles to javascript.) Readers interested
in auditing the code are invited to view it at [TODO: public github link.]

[Initial implementation is ongoing, and may lead to minor changes to
  this document. After the software is complete, the security audit
  will begin.]

\subsection{User Interface}

We have constructed a genuinely user-friendly interface to provide
users with minimal technical ability use of our Ethereum and Core
Networking software.

[Initial implementation is ongoing. Security audit will begin on
  completion, usability testing will start in earnest during our alpha
  release.]
