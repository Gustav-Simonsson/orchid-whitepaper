In this section we will examine how the system will function as the
number of users grows.

\subsection{Algorithmic Performance}

There are broadly three parts to the \Orchid{} Protocol: Ethereum-based
payments, manifolds, and the Agora.

Ethereum-based payments scale with Ethereum as normal transactions.
Having reviewed the Ethereum system design, we are confident that even
if the \Orchid{} Network is extremely successful, and becomes a
significant percentage of the Ethereum's total transaction volume,
this component will continue functioning as designed.

Manifolds are simply chains of bandwidth sellers which all have
performance independent of the total number of \Orchid{} Network
participants.

The Agora is built on a foundation of the well-studied Chord DHT. The
number of connections that Econs must maintain grows at a rate of
O(log n), to a maximum of 256 connections. Queries on the network
require O(log n) hops. Although these operations do become slower as
the network increases in size, we do not believe any significant
impact on end user perceived performance will result.

\subsection{Allocation of Scarce Resources}

The \Orchid{} Protocol is built around tokens. These tokens will allow,
through price discovery, for graceful handling of a change in balance
between buyers and sellers.

For example, if Relays are in short supply, rather than providing all
customers with a slow experience, customers will engage in a bidding
war to determine who can use the system until the shortage is
corrected. Conversely, if Relays are in abundant supply, some Relays
may leave the system until such time as prices rise.

\subsection{Real-World Performance}

[TODO: once the software is complete, we'll want fancy graphs showing
  real system performance, etc.]
