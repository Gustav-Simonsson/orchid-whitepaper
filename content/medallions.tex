Medallions form the bridge between our core security assumptions and the network as a whole. To produce a medallion, a peer takes a public key $K$, and the previous Ethereum block hash $E$, then performs a large number of computations to locate a salt $S$ such that $H(K, E, S) \geq N$, where $N$ is some difficulty scaling factor. When a new Ethereum block is added to the chain, a new $S$ must be calculated to keep the Medallion current.

\subsection{Selection of Proof-Type}

Readers who are familiar with other distributed market based networks will have recognized our core security assumptions (Section \ref{core-security}) as forming the basis for proof-of-work systems (bitcoin, etc), and may be inclined to ask: why not use proof-of-stake, proof-of-idle, or other less energetically wasteful methods for proving “realness”?

Proof-of-stake rests on the assumption that no attacker will ever control the majority of tokens. As our attack model includes oppressive governments, this can not be counted on. Even Bitcoin’s astonishing market capitalization is far less than the GDP of a modestly sized country. Making matters more complicated, in the near future we intend to extend the system to support anonymous payments, which will make detection of such a ``hostile takeover'' much more difficult. In short: we did not use proof-of-stake because we did not want to engineer a system in which our users’ right to privacy might be sold to the highest bidder.

Proof-of-space looks much more interesting. Although we are not sure that a suitable method will be located, we are exploring the possibility of using proof-of-space for an upcoming version of the \Orchid{} Protocol. This would allow old smart phones, for example, to be installed by users in their homes as Relays and Proxies. See Section \ref{future:proof-of-space}.

Proof-of-idle rests on the additional assumption that periodic, synchronized proof-of-work is sufficient to demonstrate a User’s share of the global computational power. Unfortunately, while the network is in its infancy ($\leq$ 10 million Econs), this leads to a situation where any company in control of a supercomputing center may, with only the sacrifice of ~1\% of their computational power, take control of the network. As we expect it to be quite a while before we have sufficient numbers of econs for this attack to cease being devastating, we are not using proof-of-idle for this release.

\subsection{Hash function selection}

[TODO: Professor Boneh should be consulted before this is finalized.]

One of the concerns when selecting a hash function for proof-of-work
systems is that an attacker may construct custom hardware specifically
for performing the computation. To minimize the possible impact of
this, the \Orchid{} Network uses the Equihash hash function\cite{Equihash}.

Equihash is a memory-asymmetric (proofs require large amounts of RAM,
verification does not), optimization / amortization-free (it is based on
a very well studied NP-complete problem), limited parallelism
proof-of-work scheme. We are not aware of a proof-of-work scheme more
suited to minimizing the influence of custom hardware.
